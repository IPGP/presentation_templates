Presentation Templates
======================

This repository contains templates for different presentation frameworks that
are useful for scientific talks.

Presentation Frameworks:
------------------------

### Reveal.js
Reveal.js is a javascript framework that allows to write presentations in
html/CSS and markdown. Click
[here](https://ipgp.github.io/presentation_templates/reveal.js/index.html#/) to
see an example. Although Reveal.js is principally based on HTML, slides can be
exported to PDF using e.g. the tool *decktape*. Otherwise a presentation can be
shown in the browser.

If python is installed, a local webserver can be run for example with: `python
-m http.server 8080`. Otherwise, `node.js` provides a much faster server that
can be installed with `sudo npm install http-server -g` and started with
`http-server`.
